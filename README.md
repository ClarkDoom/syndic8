### <i>Keeping up with TV content made easy and social.</i>

<br>

This app came about because I often get recommendations from my friends around what to watch and when I actually sit down and watch something I can't remember what they shared. I'm also a big letterboxd fan and have wanted similar functionality for my TV viewing experiences for quite some time, so much so that I decided to just make my own application. 

Syndicate is defined as a group of individuals or organizations combined to promote some common interest. In that spirit, the purpose of my app is to be a handy tracker but also bring people together around their shared interests and help Syndicate users find new and interesting shows they might not have otherwise tried. 

## Getting Started

## Features

- Using TMBD's open API, you are able to search for basically any show ever made. 
- Once you've found a show you're looking for, you can add to a set of custom lists - "watchlist", "currently watching", and "seen it". These lists will be available at all times in your nav bar. 
- You can also add shows to your "favorites" so that when others visit your profile, they can get a sense of your interests. 
- Every user has a public profile that displays shows you've added to your favorites, what you're currently watching, and any reviews you've written. 
 - Any logged-in user can also leave comments on reviews if you want to share your thoughts or have a conversation.
 - Security - app features are only available if you are logged in to the application and have a traceable profile.
